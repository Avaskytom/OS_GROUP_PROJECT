# OS-GROUP-PROJ

## CS 3502 –Operating Systems - Semester Project

The  semester  course  project  is  on  the  design  and  implementation  of  an  OS  simulator. The  project  is divided into two phases. Each Phasehas two parts. The requirementsare discussed below. In  this  semester  long  project,  you  are  required  to  design  and  implement  a  complete  virtual  machine, with its own virtual CPU and a control system (or Operating System), together making a Simulator. Thegiven  tasks,  or  user  programs/processes,  will  run  on  thevirtual  CPU.  The  CPU’s  architecture  and instruction repertoire are posted in the Instruction Format and Instruction Set files in the Project Folder. You will design and implementa number of programmodules in a high-level language of your choice, e.g., Java, C, C#, to complete thisOS Project.
